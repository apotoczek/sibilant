# Sibilant Lists

This project is written in Sibilant - https://sibilant.org/

This program takes in a list of strings (sample lists below) and
prints a list of each distinct string in the given input list,
along with the number of times the string occurs in the list.
The strings are ordered by most to least frequently occuring.

Install Sibilant by running:
$ npm install -g sibilant

Run foobar sibilant project:
$ sibilant -x -f foobar.sibilant

Example output for the primary test list:
[ jkl: 113, mno: 16, ghi: 15, abc: 15, pqr: 12, def: 9, foobar: 1 ]
